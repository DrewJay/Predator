Predator version 1.0.1

Description:
Greatly improved prediction performance using caching during recreating snapshots (see turboCache flag in applyPredatorInstanceSnapshot).

Todos:
- The need of actual dataset during prediction is categorically wrong. This happens because we can not normalize tensors without training dataset. This should be eliminated in the future, for example by recreating min() and max() functions so they can operate over arrays.
- generatePredictionPoints takes model as an argument, but uses instance data inside. If it has model as an argument, it should recreate the snapshot so the instance is always correct. If it has no model as an argument, it should use latestModel by default.
